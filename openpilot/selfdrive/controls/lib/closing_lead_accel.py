"""No catch-up acceleration toward a slower lead (K7 mode 5).

When the lead is far but slower than the car, the MPC still accelerates toward
the set speed because the gap is larger than desired, then brakes once the gap
closes (2026-10-03: 88 -> 99 km/h toward an 87 km/h lead at 80 m, then -1.9 m/s^2).
This ceiling only removes acceleration; it never requests braking.
